# Diabetes-Readmission-Classifier

## Overview
Our project explores error versus complexity tradeoffs for different classification models using the Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset. We investigated the efficacy of different classification methods including logistic regression, decision trees, K nearest neighbors, and neural networks, on predicting readmission results within 30 days for patients with diabetes.
